# Portofolio Selection of KOMPAS 100 Stocks Index Using B-spline based Clustering

My final project is entitled Portfolio Selection of KOMPAS 100 stocks index using b-spline based clustering. My final project will be published internationally in 2021 in the procedia computer journal elvisier held by the Bina Nusantara international conference (ICCSCI 2020). This final project analyzes the best portfolios that can be formed from the compass index of 100 from 2009 to 2018. In shaping the portfolio, it utilizes machine learning approaches such as clustering and B-spline interpolation.

quote the conclusion of my thesis is " The clustering of stocks based on the similarity of their price movements curves is a promising approach for portfolio selection, to keep diversity in a portfolio. Application of B-Spline to reduce high dimensional data during the clustering process runs well. Based on the experiment using knots 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65, the P-spline gives better RMSE than the B-spline for smaller knots. Conversely, for larger knots, start from knot 55, the B-spline is better.
Optimization of the portfolio weights of the selected stocks is a crucial process. Evaluation using back-testing data, the MV portfolios are generally less volatile, higher Sharpe index, and better cumulative performance than KOMPAS 100. A different result is for the EW portfolio, where the weights are not optimized. Generally, their performance is worst than KOMPAS 100 in volatility and Sharpe index. â€œ

This final project is completed in python programming language.
